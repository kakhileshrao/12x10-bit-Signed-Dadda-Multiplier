# 12x10-bit-Signed-Dadda-Multiplier

-This repository contains a VHDL code for 12x10 bits signed Dadda Multiplier.  

-Baugh-Wooley technique has been used to for 2's complement signed multiplication.

-A 21-bit Brent Kung Adder has been used for the final reduction stage of the dadda reduction scheme.

-A python script which generates test cases for verification of the multiplier is also present in this repo.
